Today we're going to look at a few more details about functions and how they work and operate in your code. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we like it when we're able to make use of functions that we don't have to write.  Sometimes just a brief review of available built-in functions can save you loads of work and make you a happy camper.  Here's a [list](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) of the built-in Python functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of times, though, that the built-ins and modules that you have available won't easily do what you want them to do, or you want to write something more customized to what you're working on.  These are the cases where you will write your own functions and so there are some really good things to keep in mind about functions that we're going to take a look at. Here are a couple of general references for functions:\n",

For example, if you make a list `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, and then pass it to some function, `my_function(my_list)`, it will not pass the actual contents of the list to the function but gives a reference that points to where `my_list` is currently living. This is important to remember in relation to scope as you can easily redefine the object and not update it as intended.\n",
