    "\n",
    "One of the biggest benefits of using classes is the ability to make a \"container\" that makes code more portable, like when we used functions that we can resuse. Classes give us a way to pack together certain objects and the functions we want to use with them. This is especially useful/beneficial if you have something that you will use a lot with few changes. For example, you can use a class to generate data records with functions made to populate the various fields. We'll do this in an example below."

    "\n",
    "You can think of a class as being the definition of an object, and an instance as an object using the class definition. The built-in `list` in Python is a class, we will look at some of it's components to see how natural working with classes really is.  \n",
    "\n",
