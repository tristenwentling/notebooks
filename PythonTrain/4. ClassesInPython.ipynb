For a structured approach to this process see the extra section <a href='#CRC'>below</a>\n",

Now the items in each of these categories will all share some features, like there will be a price and quantity for each of them, but they will also have their own individual characteristics, like in produce we might want to figure in a way to get the price from the weight and specify whether the price of an item is affected by weight or if it is sold by the bundle or package, so we will have to have some different details in order to implement those things."

    "Congratulations! We have now built a model of a basic grocery store using classes in Python.  Hopefully this has helped to see the process of modelling and then using classes to build something useful in Python.  Consider trying the exercises below that build on the example we have made here to get more of a feel for adding to and working with classes.\n",

    "# Exercises for Personal Enrichment\n",
    "### Difficulty: <span style=\"color:darkgreen\"> Easy </span>\n",
    "* Add more details to the facility information for the store class and add them to our example.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add one or two more class definitions for other product types in the store.  You might consider meat, bakery, freezer, or cleaning as ideas.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Extend by using inheritance the skeleton we made earlier to create some better employee classes. A couple of ways to do this would be to create classes for wage and salary employees, or managers, cashiers, and stockers as another choice. Some features you can build in might be storing their daily start and end times, salary or hourly wage amount, emergency contact, or anything else you want. You will also have to update the way employees are added in the grocery store class.\n",
    "\n",

    "* Add a method to do an inventory count for the store.  You'll want to find the number of all products grouped by department (dairy, dry goods, and produce, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Difficulty: <span style=\"color:darkred\"> Hard </span>\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a new class for the grocery store to enable customer purchases. Don't forget to add a list in the attributes of the GroceryStore class to store the records and a method to update the list. You will also have to adjust the inventory for each item purchased when a record is added.  The class should have a list of the items purchased,  their prices, and calculate a total (with taxes for bonus points). Another extra could store the name of the cashier that rang out the customer, or the customer's name.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the Product and Employee classes, we created an item number and employee number attribute.  The way it is now you must update this manually for each entry.  As the store grows keeping track of this by hand would be a burden.  Add a way to automatically assign employee numbers and item numbers without conflicts inside a grocery store.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using inheritance from the more basic level classes we've made here (Product, Employee, and Grocery Store) create a shoe store. Don't forget to think about the different kinds of product classes you might want to create."

    "One of the best ways to create class-oriented code is to use Class-responsibility-collaboration (CRC) cards (they don't have to be actual cards, but that can make things easier). Before you make CRC cards, write out (using sentences) a sketch of what you want to build.  Try and break it down to \"actors\" and \"actions\". Then the nouns and actors become your classes. Each class will get one card.\n",
    "\n",
    "So where does the responsibility and collaboration part come in?   \n",
    "\n",
    "When we looked at our overview of classes we saw that each had methods and attributes. Each of the needed attributes should get listed on the card as they are a part of what makes a class necessary.  Then the responsibilities of each class are the actions from the story that each actor performed, these will usually become methods but could be attributes as well. The collaborators are the other classes the current one works with to accomplish its actions. So on each CRC card, there should be a class name, its attributes, methods and collaborators.\n",
