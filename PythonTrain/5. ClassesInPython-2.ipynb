    "There are some benefits to using a notebook as we develop a class. For instance, it might be nice to have all of the parts laid out where we can see them and modify them as you fine tune your class methods and tweak how different components work together  as you build it up. Eventually, however, once you have finished building in all of the functionality you're looking for, it becomes much neater to make use of this portability aspect that often comes up.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the best reasons to spend the time and effort to build classes and write functions is for modularity.  We want to build things that we will be able to use more than once a lot of the time, and so instead of leaving all of this work in a notebook we can extract our efforts and write them into a module that we can import into new programs.  \n",

    "Python does have one significant drawback, called gloabl interpreter lock (GIL).  This is a well documented issue ( if you want to know more about it just google \"python GIL\" ) that basically means there is a performance limitation on the Python interpreter that processes your code.  While some libraries, like numpy, have found a way to sidestep this issue, it is generally not a trivial task to do on your own.  When you have large amounts of datasets or processes to run, this limitation can slow you down but there are ways you can make your code more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between the two terms multiprocessing and multithreading is not immediately evident, but the distinction is important to consider as the two have different purposes.  Multiprocessing is used when you want to parallelize some type of functionality, particularly things like reading and writing to or from several large files.  These operations are not slowed down so much by the interpreter lock as they are reading and writing speeds.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is there is a multiprocessing library ([see the docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html)) that can be leveraged to make this faster. Though this is not our focus, we can look briefly how it might be used. One particularly helpful application of this is creating and processing several numpy arrays or pandas dataframes. It may vary depending on the particular tasks, but often you can gain significant improvements in performance.\n",

It takes a little more to start up the multiprocessing than the built in iterators. Try uncommenting the modifications above and rerun it. You should see that the iteration method grows at a faster rate than the pool method even though initially it runs faster for smaller data.
